    # (Quantum/classical bit meaning is inferred from context)

# Bob has successfully completed the teleportation. (He can measure the result).
4.5 M 0 2

# ELSE is also available, but IF currently only takes ONE classical bit index.
# CLASSICAL Boolean operations are available to manipulate classical bit registers.
# Ex.:
# AND 0 1 2
# i.e.: "AND" the values of classical bit indices 0 and 1, and place the result in index 2.
